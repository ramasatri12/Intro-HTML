<!-- Definition of HTML Headings
Definition of Headings:

Headings are HTML elements used to define titles and subtitles on a web page. They help organize content and provide a clear structure, making it easier to read and understand.
Hierarchy of Headings:

HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>. Each level indicates the importance of the information presented, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> being the least important.
Explanation of Each Heading Tag
<h1>:

Used for the main title of the page. Ideally, there should only be one <h1> per page to maintain a clear structure.
<h2>:

Represents major sections under the <h1>, akin to chapter titles within the main document.
<h3>:

For subsections of <h2>, further breaking down the content into manageable parts.
<h4>, <h5>, <h6>:

Continue the hierarchy, providing structure to increasingly smaller subsections.
Importance of Properly Using Headings
SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

Headings help search engines understand the content structure. Properly using headings can enhance your site's visibility in search results.
Accessibility:

Screen readers rely on headings to navigate through content. A well-structured heading system ensures that users with disabilities can easily understand and navigate the page. -->
