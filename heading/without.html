Plain Text Structure: This section shows how the content looks without any HTML tags. Highlight that while it is still readable, it lacks structure.

Hierarchy Absence: Emphasize that without headings, there is no clear indication of how the content is organized, which can make it difficult for readers (and search engines) to understand the structure.
